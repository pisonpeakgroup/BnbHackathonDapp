## Introduction
DAM Dapp is a collection of Open Source Dapps, with Smart Contracts deployed. It is a "Binance Hackathon" project, aiming to make experience of cryptocurrency trading and management.

## Included Dapps

### USDJ Exchange
 - Contract 
 
The USDJ Exchange enables quick and easy trade between TRX and USDJ, right on DAM Dapp! Every trade is met with a 2% fee, which goes directly towards maintenance of the DAM Dapp platform.
 
### FunctionNamesContract
 - Contract 
 
FunctionNamesContract is an interface and contract pairing added to DAM Dapp, enabling users to set and change a Username for their address when their wallet is unlocked and enabled on the website. Secondary functions include the ability to buy a name for an address that is not your own. This may be a nice little gift idea for a fellow player.

### D1VS Game
 - Contract 
 
D1VS is an Hourglass "Proof of Weak Hands" game, with 10% Buy/Sell Fees, and 3% Referral Bonus rates. Dividends are earned as players buy and sell D1VS. Compound your earnings or withdraw anytime. This contract is also assisted by a secondary contract, "Pricefloor" - this contract holds D1VS, earning TRX Dividends like any other player. Pricefloor can never sell or transfer its D1VS - it can only keep buying more, reinvesting into the D1VS contract. As time goes on with the D1VS contract being used more, the Pricefloor will act as a "last player" - so if everyone sold out, the "second-last" player will always get SOMETHING for their D1VS.
